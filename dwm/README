Patches work if applied on a vanilla 5.8.2 in ascending order.

pertag2.diff, nbstack.c:
  (from https://github.com/simongmzlj/dwmhacks)
  - Changes the tile arranger to a modified non-greedy ntile, adds pertag mfact,
    nmaster, and layouts, and the ability to configure individual pertag
    defaults. nbstack.c is a bstack variant of ntile.

statuscolors.diff:
  (from http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscolors)
  - I only changed the current window's title background to normal.

gaps.diff:
  (from https://github.com/simongmzlj/dwmhacks)
  - Adds gaps around the edges of windows correctly. Doesn't break on floating
    windows, doesn't add a double with gap in between windows. Can be enabled
    per layout.

pango.diff:
  (from http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=33193)

opacity.diff, opacity.c:
  (from https://github.com/simongmzlj/dwmhacks)
  - Makes unfocused windows shade. Allows for setting individual window
    transparency.
  - Doesn't work here at the moment... rxvt-unicode works fine, but Firefox and
    other applications are invisible.

disable_focus_follows_mouse.diff:
  - Self explainable.

scratchpad_stay.diff:
  (from https://github.com/lolilolicon/dwm)

push.c
  (from http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/push)

gaplessgrid.c
  (from http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/gapless_grid)

pidgin_ggrid.c
  - Based of https://github.com/simongmzlj/dwmhacks/blob/master/pidgin.c and
    gaplessgrid.c
  - Your Pidgin's buddy list occupies the leftmost mfact% of the screen, and 
    all chat windows use the remaining space in a gaplessgrid fashion.
